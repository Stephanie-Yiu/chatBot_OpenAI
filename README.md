# chatBot_OpenAI


#14th March 2023 
The code appears to be a basic chatbot application that uses the OpenAI API for natural language processing. The code consists of two parts: the client-side code that runs in the browser and the server-side code that runs on a node.js server.

The client-side code sets up an event listener for form submissions and sends a request to the server-side code. The server-side code takes the user input and uses the OpenAI API to generate a response. Once the response is generated, it is sent back to the client-side code, which updates the chat display with the bot's response.

The client-side code uses vanilla JavaScript and HTML to create the user interface. The chat display is updated by adding new chat messages as HTML elements to a container div. The server-side code uses the express.js framework to create an HTTP server and the OpenAI API to generate responses.

Overall, this code appears to be a good starting point for creating a chatbot application that uses natural language processing to generate responses.

# will update it soon
